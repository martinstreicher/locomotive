<h1>
	The Fast and the Furious On Rails
	</h1>

<p>
	Instant gratification is one of the real joys of developing software. Like many other crafts, coding shapes raw materials into a novel work. Tap-tap-tap and a new machine is born.
	</p>
	
<p>
	Perhaps it's no wonder that so many developers have adopted frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. Given tools such as routes, the ActiveRecord object-relational mapping (ORM), migrations, and a vast collection of open source contributions, it's easy to realize features quickly. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	But before you go all fast and furious, you must first leave the driveway. In the case of Rails, prep typically requires the installation of your essential gems and plug-ins, a modicum of configuration, the (re)creation of helpful initializers, and more. Certainly, setup occurs once, but repetition quickly becomes painful -- like driving the Audi R8 super car through Midtown traffic. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	Here's a picture of the R8 to emphasize the point. Ouch.
	</p>
	
<div>
	<p class="image">
		<img src="images/r8.jpg" width="55%" alt="The Audi R8 super car" />
	</p>
</div>
	
<p>
	To simplify the creation process, thus saving the sanity of many a Rails developer, a number of bootstrap kits are available. <a href="http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master">Bort</a>, for example, 
	</p> packages a set of plug-ins commonly used to create sites, including an asset packager (to bundle and compress JavaScript and CSS files into a single download), Rspec (to support test-driven development), and RESTful authentication (to create and activate user accounts). You can download Bort with the command <tt>git clone	git://github.com/fudgestudios/bort.git</tt>. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	The <a href="http://railskits.com/available-kits/">RailsKits</a> website also offers a number of specialized kits, some for free and some for a nominal fee. Of course, you can also download any number of open source Rails applications to base your work on. (Be mindful of the terms of the license.) 
	</p>
	
<p>
	Bort is very capable and I've employed it to launch some of my own projects. Moreover, you can easily extend Bort with additional plug-ins and other custom code to create your own kernel. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	However, Bort has two significant limitations: if your form of application differs, Bort is of little use; and Bort doesn't affect the system software. If you regularly require specific gems or other tasks to prep the system for the application, Bort is of little use. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	But hang on there, Mr. Diesel. Rails 2.3 offers another, much more flexible approach: the <i>application template</i>. 
	</p>
	

<h2>
	Vroom, Vroom!
	</h2>
	
<p>
	Created by <a href="http://www.jeremymcanally.com/">Jeremy McAnally</a> and  new to Rails 2.3, an application template (here, let's call it a boilerplate to avoid overloading the term template). The application boilerplate is a set of instructions to generate a new Rails application and mold the entire environment to suit. The boilerplate is a simple Ruby script, albeit with calls to a number of specialized, domain-specific methods. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	For instance, the boilerplate "language" includes the method-cum-keyword <tt>plugin</tt> to install a plugin during the generation of a new application. Thus, if you wanted to install the handy Paperclip plug-in into a new application instance, create the script <i>paperclip.rb</i> with contents &hellip;
	</p>
	
<pre class="list">
plugin( 'paperclip', :git => git://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip.git )
</pre>

&hellip; and run the command <tt>rails album -m paperclip.rb</tt>&hellip;

<pre>
$ <b>rails --version</b>
Rails 2.3.2
$ <b>rails album -m paperclip.rb</b>
    create  
    create  app/controllers
    ...
  applying  template: paperclip.rb
    plugin  paperclip
    
Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
From git://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip
* branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD

   applied  paperclip.rb
$ <b>ls album/vendor/plugins/</b>
paperclip
</pre>
	

<h2>
	A Better Bort
	</h2>
	
<p>
	Let's march through a more lengthy example to learn more about the available boilerplate methods. Specifically, let's look at Jeremy McAnally's boilerplate to replace Bort. (Jeremy offers a number of boilerplates via his <a href="http://github.com/jeremymcanally/rails-templates/tree/master">GitHub account</a>.)  Here is <i>bort.rb</i>. 
	</p>
	
<pre class="list">
# bort.rb
# from Jeremy McAnally, Pratik Naik
# based on bort by Jim Neath
Ê
inside('vendor') do
ÊÊrun "ln -s ~/commit-rails/rails rails"
end
Ê

ÊÊ:git => 'git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec.git'

</pre>

<p>
	The keywords of the boilerplate domain-specific language are largely self-explanatory, making the intent of an application template easy to comprehend. 
	</p>
	
<ul>
	<li><tt>inside()</tt> requires the path to a directory. This method changes directory to the named path and executes each command in the block within that directory. This <tt>inside()</tt> command is unique to Jeremy's environment: he links <i>vendor/rails</i> (the application's frozen Rails code) to Edge Rails found in <i>~/commit-rails/rails</i>. (You can safely remove this block or adapt it to your own environment.)</li>

	<li>The next series of instructions should be familiar: Each statement installs a plug-in. In addition to <tt>:git</tt>, you can also use <tt>:svn</tt>. </li>
	
	<li>The next operator, <tt>gem</tt>, does not install a gem. Instead, per convention, it adds a <tt>gem.config</tt> entry to <i>environment.rb</i> to connote that the application depends on the named gem. Here, three gems are required: <tt>will_paginate</tt> to paginate results; <tt>rubyist-aasm</tt> ("acts as state machine") to track sign-up progress from new user to registered user;  and <tt>ruby-openid</tt> to support OpenID authentication. </li>

	<li>The next statement, <tt>rake("gems:install", :sudo => true)</tt> is the same as the command <tt>sudo rake gems:install</tt>. It enumerates the gem prerequisities and installs the gems as <i>root</i>. </li>

	<li>Finally, the boilerplate runs two generators, the equivalent of the commands&hellip;
<pre>
ruby script/generate authenticated user session
ruby script/generate rspec
</pre></li>
	</ul>

<p>
	In addition to these operations, you can create new routes with <tt>route()</tt>, add new <i>rake</i> tasks with <tt>rakefile()</tt>, and install an initializer with <tt>initializer()</tt>. Similar to <tt>initializer()</tt>, convenience methods <tt>lib()</tt>,  <tt>vendor()</tt>, and <tt>file()</tt> add a file to the <i>lib</i> and <i>vendor</i> directories, and any directory relative to RAILS_ROOT, respectively. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	For example, you could use initializer() to create a list of date formats you commonly use. 
	</p>
	
<pre class="list">
initializer 'date_formats.rb', <<-CODE
ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Time::Conversions::DATE_FORMATS.merge!(
  :date             => '%m/%d/%Y',
  :date_time12      => '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M%p',
  :date_time24      => '%m/%d/%Y %H:%M',
  :day_date         => '%a %m/%d/%Y',
  :day_date_time12  => '%a %m/%d/%Y | %I:%M%p',   
  :day_date_time24  => '%a %m/%d/%Y | %H:%M'
)
CODE
</pre>
	
<p>
	Once so defined, you can convert a date to a pretty string with simple code such as <tt>@message.sent.to_s( :day_date_time12 )</tt>. 
	</p>
	
<p>	
	You can even drop your newly-generated application into Git with keyword <tt>git</tt>. 
	</p>	

<pre class="list">
git :init
git :add => "."
git :commit => "-a -m 'Initial commit'"
</pre>
	
	
<h2>
	More Goodies
	</h2>

<p>
	Application templates are sure to save you time and headaches when creating a new application. Happily, the same automation can be applied to an existing application, too. The new <i>rake</i> task <tt>rails:template</tt> can apply a boilerplate script to an existing body of code. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	For instance, to add the Paperclip plug-in to an existing work, just point to the script:
	</p>
	
<pre>
$ rake rails:template LOCATION=~/templates/paperclip.rb
</pre>

<p>
	You can share boilerplate scripts as well. If the Paperclip template is located at http://example.com/templates/paperclip.rb.txt, simply point to the URL: 
	</p>
	
<pre>
$ rails album -m http://example.com/templates/paperclip.rb.txt
</pre>
	
<p>
	Until a <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guide</a> for application templates is available, you can read about all the boilerplate   capabilities at <a href="http://m.onkey.org/2008/12/4/rails-templates">Pratik Naik's blog</a>. If you craft a helpful application template, consider sharing it with Jeremy.  
	</p>
	
<p>
	If you combine the features of application template, <tt>rake rails:freeze:edge</tt>, and <tt>config.gem</tt>, you should have little hassle  sharing a complete, stand-alone application with others. 
	</p>
	
<p>
	Until next time, happy tinkering.
