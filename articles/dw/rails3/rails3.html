<h1>
  All Aboard! An Introduction to Rails 3
  </h1>

<p>
  Over the past two years, the Ruby on Rails application framework has garnered a cottage industry of hosting and service providers, an expansive and impressive array of development tools, and a wide variety of complementary libraries -- called <em>gems</em> and <em>plug-ins</em> in Ruby parlance -- that increase the capabilities of the software. For example, Engine Yard and Heroku are just two companies that provide virtual and headache-free Rails software hosting; the colorfully-named <em>Oink</em> and <em>Bullet</em> profile memory usage and performance, respectively; and  <em>Clearance</em> and <em>Sunspot</em> provide off-the-shelf authentication and fast, indexed search. </p>

<p>
  Since 2007, the Rails community has grown, too.  The global legion of Rails developers is vibrant, helpful, and always eager to improve the software.
  Indeed, it's not hyperbole to say the community is hell-bent on improving
  Rails, with coders constantly leapfrogging one another to build something better. Iteration after iteration, features quickly evolve from nascent, to utilitarian, to powerful, to elegant, and ultimately to indispensable. In many instances, gems and plug-ins the community finds essential are enshrined in the Rails core. Rails's <em>named scopes</em> -- a query shorthand -- followed that very trajectory, as did <em>nested forms,</em> a fairly recent addition that supplanted previous attempts to create and edit multiple models within the same HTML form. Indeed, perhaps the most difficult task for Rails developers is keeping pace with change. (Luckily, a number of weekly Ruby and Ruby on Rails podcasts organize and present trends and best practices.)</p>

<p>
  Rails 3, the next major release of Rails, continues the rapid advancement of the toolkit. True to its heritage, the software remains "opinionated", preferring convention over configuration. Rails's core components -- RESTful routes, relationships, validations, templates, and database abstractions -- persist. However, much of the internals of those units have been rewritten or refined. Most notably, and borrowing heavily from Merb, many of Rails's essential features are no longer tightly-coupled. For instance, the data validation conveniences previously available only to a Rails application are now standalone and can be included in vanilla Ruby code. Controller capabilities -- such as rendering partials and templates -- are also independent and can be embedded in any library.</p>

<p>
  Here, let's look at Rails 3 and its many changes and additions, and create a new Rails 3 application from scratch. As of the middle of February 2010, Rails 3 is a beta pre-release, and the core team is collecting patches, feedback, and documentation to prepare an official release prior to the start of Summer. Nonetheless, the current incarnation of Rails 3 is sufficient for building applications and learning about the multitude of new capabilities.</p>


<h2>
  Big Changes, Little Changes
  </h2>

<p>
  The number of changes in Rails 3 is too significant to recount fully here. To read a complete list along with supplemental material, consult the <em>Rails 3 Release Notes</em>. Here, however, are some of the alterations most likely to affect developers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>One command to rule them all.</b> Rails 3 obsoletes the family of scripts (<em>script/server</em>, <em>script/generate</em>, et al) found in each application and replaces it with a single command, aptly named <em>rails</em>. For example, where you previously typed <tt>./script/console</tt>, you now type <tt>rails console</tt>. The <em>rails</em> command also generates new applications, as it did before. Its operation differs whether or not it's launched amid an existing Rails application.</li>

  <li>
    <b>A manifest solution for dependencies.</b> Reconciling and resolving gem dependencies is something of a knotty problem. Gem revisions can vary from one system to another, as can the collection of available gems. With such variety, it can be difficult to widely deploy or share a Rails application. Rails 3 introduces <em>Bundler</em>, a special utility to manage dependencies (thus obsoleting <tt>config.gem</tt>).  Dependences are declared in a catalog named <em>Gemfile</em> in the root of your application. Bundler downloads and stores all the named gems. You can even "pack" the gems in your application to preclude downloads from external repositories.</li>

  <li>
    <b>Queries without the queries.</b> Historically, Rails had made good use of DSL's throughout -- think of <tt>has_one</tt> or <tt>validates_numericality_of</tt> -- with one notable exception:  database queries. Certainly, Rails's dynamic finders ease the burden, but code littered with option hashes replete with <tt>:conditions</tt>, <tt>:order</tt>, and <tt>:limit</tt> are very common, as are <tt>find_by_sql</tt> statements. Rails 3 incorporates <em>relational algebra</em>, a DSL designed to express queries. Primitives include <tt>project</tt> (to select columns), <tt>where</tt> (to express conditions), <tt>join</tt> (to specify relationships), <tt>take</tt> and <tt>skip</tt> (for lmits and offsets, respectively), and <tt>group</tt> (for aggregation), among others.</li>

  <li>
    <b>Controllers sans that fussy boilerplate code.</b> The core actions of a Rails controller -- <tt>new</tt>, <tt>create</tt>, <tt>edit</tt>, <tt>update</tt> -- typically do not vary, especially if the controller is largely there for CRUD operations. In fact, the output of the controller generator, <tt>./script/generate controller</tt>, often suffices without further modification. Given those similarities, Rails 3 introduces the <tt>Responder</tt> to simplify the code further. For example, a few lines of code is all that's needed for a <tt>create</tt> action:

<pre>
  class PostsController
    respond_to :html, :xml

    def create
      @post = Post.create(params[:post])
      respond_with(@post)
    end
  end
</pre>

	In the snippet, <tt>respond_with(@post)</tt> routes to <em>show</em> to display the new record if <tt>@post</tt> was saved successfully, or to <tt>new</tt> if the object failed validations, say.
	</li>
  </ul>

<p>
	Again, this is just a small sampling. You can find examples of these new features and more in the next section, which builds a Rails 3 application from scratch.</p>


<h2>
	A First Rails 3 Application
	</h2>

<p>
  To run Rails 3, your system must have either Ruby 1.8.7 or Ruby 1.9.2 or a newer release of the programming language and its attendant llibraries and interpreter. It is also beneficial to have the Git software version control system installed on your machine, as Rails 3 and many other influential Rails projects are maintained in Git. Your system should also have a database engine, such as SQLite (version 3), MySQL, or PostgreSQL. A Web server is not required to develop a Rails application, but is usually part of a production deployment.</p>

<p>
  To create a Rails 3 application, you must have the Rails 3 pre-release gem and all its dependencies. At the moment, you can install the required components with just a few commands. (Check the documentation for Rails 3 before you continue as the specifics may change from release to release.)</p>

</pre>

<p>
	The next step is to generate the application. Here, let's build a small wiki. The application creates and administers articles. Each article has a title and some prose, and a new article is created simply by creating a reference to it from the body of an existing page. A reference is any "camel case" word, such as "TheSolarSystem" or "TheOscars".</p>

<pre>
$ rails wiki
</pre>

<p>
	If you run ls -lR to see the contents of the application, a few new files stand out:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Gemfile</em> is the gem manifest mentioned earlier. At a mininum, the file must contain two lines: one to point to the source of the Rails 3 beta gem and one to bundle the Rails 3 beta gem itself. You probably want a third line (at least) to connect to a database.

<pre>
source 'http://gemcutter.org'
gem "rails", "3.0.0.beta"
gem "sqlite3-ruby", :require => "sqlite3"
</pre></li>

	<li><em>config/application.rb</em> contains many of the options previously found in <em>config/environment.rb</em>. The latter remains, but is largely deprecated. One significant addition to <em>config/application.rb</em> is the <em>generators block</em>.

<pre>
config.generators do |g|
  g.orm             :active_record
  g.template_engine :erb
  g.test_framework  :test_unit, :fixture => true
end
</pre>

	<p>
		Your Rails 3 application can use one of a number of compatible object-relational mappers (ORM), template engines, and test frameworks. The generators block specifies your preferences for the application and invokes the proper generator for your models, views, and so on.
		</p></li>

	<li>
		<em>db/seeds.rb</em> is not new to Rails 3, but is important to mention since it was added fairly recently (it was introduced in Rails 2.3.4). If your application requires initial data to run properly -- such as an administrative user, price codes, or static pages -- create that data in  <em>db/seeds.rb</em> and run the task <tt>rake db:seed</tt>. Prior to the seed file, no convention existed for initialization and many developers put code in migrations, clouding the differentiation between creating the database and populating it.</li>

	<li><em>config.ru</em>, found in the root of each Rails 3 application, is a so-called "rackup" file, or a configuration for a Rack-based application. Rails 3 is a Rack application and is compatible with any Web server that also supports Rack. In general, you need not touch <em>config.ru</em>, unless you want to add other Rack components.</li></ul>

<p>
	There are a few other new files; most, though, should seem familar from Rails 2.3. <em>config/routes.rb</em> serves the same purpose as before, albeit with a much-simplified and more Ruby-like flavor. You'll see an example momentarily.</p>


<p>
	After you generate the application and edit <em>Gemfile</em> to capture your dependencies, your next step is to collect the gems your application requires. That's the job of the new utility, <em>bundle</em>.</p>

<p>
	<em>bundle</em>, short for Bundler, downloads and installs all the gems named in <em>Gemfile</em> and any of those gems' prerequisites. <em>bundle</em> can also copy all those dependencies into your application, making your code base self-sufficient. Specifically, if you run <tt>bundle pack</tt>, the Bundler copies the corpus of gems to <em>vendor/cache</em>.</p>

<h2>
	Working on the wiki
	</h2>

<p>
	To create the application, let's generate a scaffold for a page, create the database, seed the database with an initial page, and set up the necessary  routes.</p>

<p>
	To keep things simple, a wiki page record is limited to a handful of fields: a title, a slug (an abbreviation of the title), a body, and timestamps to record when the page was created and when it was last modified. The title and slug are string fields; prose is a text field, and the timestamps are date and time fields. (Of course, a real wiki would have additional fields, such as the most recent author and previous revisions of the page. For brevity, this example also omits users and sessions, formatting, and any kind of authentication and authorization.) You can generate an initial model, set of views, and a controller with the command <tt>rails generate scaffold</tt>.</p>

<pre>
$ rails generate scaffold page title:string slug:string body:text --timestamps
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20100221115613_create_pages.rb
      create    app/models/page.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/unit/page_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/pages.yml
       route  resources :pages
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/pages_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/pages
      create      app/views/pages/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/pages/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/pages/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/pages/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/pages/_form.html.erb
      create      app/views/layouts/pages.html.erb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/functional/pages_controller_test.rb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/pages_helper.rb
      invoke      test_unit
      create        test/unit/helpers/pages_helper_test.rb
      invoke  stylesheets
      create    public/stylesheets/scaffold.css
</pre>

<p>
	(What happened to <tt>./script/generate?</tt> Recall that its now subsumed by the omnipotent <em>rails</em> command.)</p>

<p>
	Run <tt>rake db:create db:migrate</tt> to create the database.</p>

<pre>
$ rake db:create db:migrate
==  CreatePages: migrating ====================================================
-- create_table(:pages)
   -> 0.0010s
==  CreatePages: migrated (0.0011s) ===========================================
</pre>

<p>
	The wiki exists now, but is empty. Let's add an initial page to serve as an anchor for all other pages. Edit the file <em>db/seeds.rb</em> and write code to create a new page.</p>

<pre>
Page.create(
  :title    => 'The Marx Brothers Wiki',
  :slug     => 'Home',
  :body     => 'An encyclopedic guide to the Marx Brothers.')
</pre>

<p>
	Run <tt>rake db:seed</tt> to execute the code. You can verify the page with a quick glance via <tt>rails console</tt>.</p>

<pre>
$ rake db:seed
(in /Users/strike/projects/rails3/wiki)

$ rails console
Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.0.beta)
irb(main):001:0> Page.all
=> [#&lt;Page id: 1, title: "The Marx Brothers Wiki", slug: "Home", body: "An encyclopedic guide to the Marx Brothers.", created_at: "2010-02-21 12:24:43", updated_at: "2010-02-21 12:24:43"&gt;]
</pre>

<p>
	Before proceeding further with the code, let's setup the routes. Two are required: a default route to find the home page and another route to find a page by its slug. Here's the final <em>config/routes.rb</em></p>

<pre>
Wiki::Application.routes.draw do |map|
  resources :pages
  root :to => "pages#show"
end
</pre>

<p>
	The <tt>rails generate scaffold page</tt> automatically created the route on line 2, which is RESTful. The route on line 3 must be added manually. The syntax to specify a default, "root" of the site route, is new in Rails 3. Line 3 says, "Map the route '/' to the 'show' method of the pages controller." The code for the <tt>show</tt> method will find the home page in the database and display it.</p>

<p>
	After adding the new root route, delete the file <em>public/index.html</em> to preclude conflicts.</p>

<pre>
$ rm public/index.html
</pre>

<p>
	Let's now turn attention to the page controller. The code for a controller in Rails 3 can be exceedingly spartan. Here is the initial implementation of the controller, with a sole <tt>show</tt> method.
	</p>

<pre>
class PagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  respond_to :html

  def show
    @page = Page.where( :slug => ( params[:id] || 'Home' ) ).first
    respond_with( @page )
  end
end
</pre>

<p>
	As you can see, all the boilerplate typically found in a Rails 2 controller is missing. <tt>respond_to</tt> lists the formats the controller supports; here, it responds solely to requests for HTML. <tt>respond_with</tt> is a shorthand for the logic to decide how the controller should proceed.</p>

<p>
	The syntax for the query is also quite different. The lookup is an example of the Rails 3 relational algebra. You may be wondering why the <tt>first</tt> suffix is required. <tt>where</tt> and other operands that express the query do not actually cause the query to execute. Instead, the query sits idly by until the data is actually needed. This is <em>lazy loading</em>, or deferring the query as long as possible. <tt>first</tt> sparks an actual inquiry from the database.</p>

<p>
	If you run the application now, you should see something similar to Figure 1.</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/fig1.jpg" />
	</p>

<p>
	Let's add more code to the controller. The next listing shows the complete controller.</p>

<pre>
class PagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  respond_to :html
  before_filter :get_page, :except =&gt; [ :create ]

  def create
    respond_with( @page = Page.create( params[ :page ] ) )
  end

  def edit
  end

  def index
    render :action =&gt; :show
  end

  def show
    @page ||= Page.new( :slug =&gt; params[ :id ] )

    if @page.new_record?
      render :action =&gt; :new
    else
      respond_with( @page )
    end
  end

  def update
    @page.update_attributes( params[ :page ] )
    respond_with( @page )
  end

  private

    def get_page
      @page = Page.where( :slug =&gt; ( params[:id] || 'Home' ) ).first ||
        Page.where( :id =&gt; params[:id] ).first
    end
end
</pre>

<p>
	In the controller, the <tt>index</tt> method merely reflects to the <tt>show</tt> action with no page identifier, thus rendering the home page. <tt>show</tt> displays a page, given an ID or a slug (the lookups for all actions are centralized in <tt>get_page</tt>, further reducing the amount of code); if a page does not exist, a new page is prepared for editing.</p>

<p>
	The <tt>Page</tt> model merely validates that all its fields are present.</p>

<pre>
class Page &gt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :body, :slug, :title
end
</pre>

<p>
	The work to translate the camelcase references to links to other pages occurs in the view for the <tt>Page</tt> model. A helper function in <em>app/helpers/pages_helper.rb</em> does the heavy lifting, keeping the view minimal.</p>

<pre>
module PagesHelper
  def wikify( page )
    return '' if page.body.blank?
    page.body.gsub( /^([A-Z][[:alnum:]]*([A-Z][[:alnum:]]*)+)/ ) do |match|
      link_to( $1, :action => :show, :id =&gt; $1 )
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>
	The view is typical.
	</p>

<pre>
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Title:&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;%= @page.title %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Body:&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;%= raw wikify( @page ) %&gt;

<p>
	The <tt>raw</tt> operator is new to Rails 3. Counter to previous releases of Rails, all strings are emitted safe, stripped of HTML, by default. If you want to emit a string with HTML, you must use <tt>raw</tt>.</p>

	Switching Rails

<p>
	Beyond the improvements and conveniences shown here, Rails 3 offers better performance than its predecessors, especially in rendering partials. You can also create your own validator classes and take advantage of more streamlined standard validations. For instance, this validation, written by Jeremy Macnally, once required four separate lines of code.
	</p>

<pre>
validates :login, :presence => true, :length => {:minimum => 4},
  :uniqueness => true, :format => { :with => /[A-Za-z0-9]+/ }
</pre>

<p>
	The Rails Guides, the official tutorials for Rails, are currently being updated for Rails 3. You can also find extensive instruction and clever solutions on the blogs of Jeremy Macanally, Yehuda Katz, Gregg Pollack, and other community leaders. A number of popular books are under revision for the new release, too, including the seminal "pickaxe" book, <em>Agile Web Development with Rails.</em></p>
